# Macro_about_graph
#I planned the project because I wanted to input various information and let you know the graph with the most visible change value.
#The project plans to unify the styles of graphs, except for graphs with meaningful information.
#This project will have the advantage of being able to easily use the features you want, and will reduce the annoyance of programming every time.
#Through this work, I will become familiar with the process of creating open sources and help me understand matplotlib.
